## Adult :lips:

### Filter out and hide videos by quality

I have never seen this done before.

By placing each rule in its own list. We can selectively hide uploaded videos, by their resolution (video quality). Then toggle on and off when desired.

Some sites allow you to filter by quality, but limited only to the search page. These rules can apply globally across the entire site.

Import __ALL__ lists following this filename pattern.

```
neuronx-adult-SITE_no_QUALITY.txt
```

Then uncheck the list, you __DO NOT__ want to filter out and block.

For example, to see only 4K uploads:

1. Check (enable) __ALL__ lists.
2. Uncheck (disable) list `_no_4k` or `_no_2160p`.

> [!TIP]
> Keep extension page open, in a new window, if you want to toggle `_no_QUALITY` frequently.
